# Frontend Application

This is the frontend part of the my-fullstack-app project, built using React. It provides a user interface for the application, allowing users to log in and interact with the backend services.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- User login form that connects to the backend API.
